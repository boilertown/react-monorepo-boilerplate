## Introduction

**react-monorepo-boilerplate** is the first production-ready boilerplate from [Boilertowns][boilertowns-url] creations.

The goal of this boilerplate is to maximize your effectiveness by present you:

- üöÄ A good application structure which is simple, scalable and easy to maintain.
- üî• Give you best and hot tools in the ecosystem to manage the workflows.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Easy to customize your workflows. You will have all the granular control over all the operations.
- üßë‚Äçüíª Improve your Developer eXperience (DX). You can just focus on coding and press Save button.

This setup is _opinionated_ as it is based on my experience of working with difference React projects. It works very well to me and my team and I hope I can make you feel the same.

- [React Router v6][react-router-url]

- UI development with [Storybook][storybook-url]
- Unit test with [Testing-library][testing-library-url]
- Linting with [Eslint][eslint-url] and code formatting with [Prettier][prettier-url]
- Conventional commit messages with [Commitlint][commitlint-url]
- Monorepo codebase management with [Turborepo][turbo-url]
- Automated release with [changesets][changesets-url]
